# John Hoopes: Portfolio

_Design, Development, Data Science_

### Invisible Origins

**[Web app](https://robisoniv.github.io/casa-digital-visualisation/ui/) / [Code](https://github.com/robisoniv/casa-digital-visualisation)**


For UCL's Digital Visualisation module, I led the design and development of Invisible Origins, an interactive interface intended to serve as a framework for visualizing any spatial and non-spatial dataset. We challenged ourselves to visualize 2D and 3D maps, vector and raster layers, and to seamlessly move from global to regional to local extents.

Skills demonstrated:
- UX design
- UI development
- Javascript
  - D3.js
  - Mapboxgl.js
- HTML / CSS
  - Bootstrap

### The Patterns of War: A fatality-weighted spatio-temporal KMeans clustering analysis of conflict events in Yemen, 2016 - 2018

**[Report](https://github.com/robisoniv/conflict-kmeans/blob/master/yemen-kmeans-paper.pdf) / [iPython Notebooks](https://github.com/robisoniv/conflict-kmeans)**

This analysis sought to understand trends in conflict events in Yemen by clustering conflict events by spatial and temporal dimensions (based on the [Armed Conflict Location Event Dataset](https://www.acleddata.com/)).

Skills demonstrated:
- Python
  - sklearn
  - pandas
- D3.js
- Research
- Writing

### Sovereign Project

**[Code]() / [Research](https://github.com/robisoniv/self-sovereign-organization/tree/master/notes)**

To better understand the intricacies of autonomous organizations and improve my Solidity skills, I worked with a team to develop Sovereign Project, a vanilla Solidity implementation of a DAO to manage the informational and financial assets of a collaborative project on the Ethereum blockchain.

Skill demonstrated:
- Solidity / web3.js
- dApp design
- Project management
