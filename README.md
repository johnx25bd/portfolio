### Invisible Origins

For UCL's Digital Visualisation module, I led the design and development of Invisible Origins, an interactive interface intended to serve as a framework for visualizing any spatial and non-spatial dataset. We challenged ourselves to visualize 2D and 3D maps, vector and raster layers, and to seamlessly move from global to regional to local extents.

Skills demonstrated:
- UX design
- UI development
- D3.js
- Mapboxgl.js
- Bootstrap
